Amazon Alexa is a cloud-based voice service developed by Amazon that allows customers to interact with technology. There are currently over 40 million Alexa users around the world, so analyzing user sentiments about Alexa will be a good data science project. So, if you want to learn how to analyze the sentiments of users using Amazon Alexa, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll walk you through the task of Amazon Alexa Reviews Sentiment Analysis Using Python.

The dataset I’m using for the task of sentiment analysis of Amazon Alexa reviews was collected from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/amazon-alexa-reviews). It contains data about ratings between 1 and 5, the date of reviews, and customer feedback on their experience with Alexa.
